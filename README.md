The repository contains Supplementary Materials for the research article with the same title.

Data Availability Statement – Restrictions apply to the availability of these data. Data was obtained
from ABB company and are available with the third party’s permission

We use 32x32-sized thermal Images of Switchgear equipment the images were captured by four infrared cameras monitoring low-voltage switchgear busbar cable connections. Cameras record a healthy baseline for a period of time, then several faults are introduced to the switchgear:

Notes:
- Trained models with each dataset are made available.
- Thermal image samples for visualization and localization of anomalies are made available in separate directory.
